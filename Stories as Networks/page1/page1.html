        <p> In life, the number of <a href="../Index.html">beginnings</a> is exactly equal to the number of <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span>ings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span> it. </p></h1>

        <p> In poetry, the number of <a href="../Index.html">beginnings</a> so far exceeds the number of <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span>ings that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire <a href="../page2/page2.html" class="and">and</a> is carried away by the wind, which may be an <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span>ing, but it is the <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span> of a poem without an <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span>. </p>
        
        <p> Paul Valéry, the French poet <a href="../page2/page2.html" class="and">and</a> thinker, once said that no poem is ever <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span>ed, that every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations <a href="../Index.html">begin</a> is in a cloud. </p>
        
        <p> Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, <a href="../page2/page2.html" class="and">and</a> to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, <a href="../page2/page2.html" class="and">and</a> the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall. </p>
        
        <p> In the <a href="../Index.html">beginning</a> was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. <a href="../page2/page2.html" class="and">And</a> yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the <span id="changeable" class="end">end</span> was the Act. that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. </p>
