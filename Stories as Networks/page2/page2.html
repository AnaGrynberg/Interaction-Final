            <p>I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the <span class="end-word"> end </span>of a poem than it is to talk about its <span class="beginning-word">beginning</span>. Because the poem <span class="end-word"> ends </span> on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, <span class="highlight">and</span> it's your house. </p>
            <p> An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes <span class="highlight">and</span> always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, <span class="highlight">and</span>  has been from its <span class="beginning-word">beginning</span>; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action <span class="highlight">and</span>  observe it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre. </p>
            <p>Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems <span class="beginning-word">begin</span>, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. <span class="highlight">And</span>  the lesson is always the same, <span class="highlight">and</span>  young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-<span class="end-word"> end </span>alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial <span class="highlight">and</span>  error. </p>
